# Asset-Management-and-Performance-Analysis
I evaluate the U.S. equity portfolio using a Morningstar Style Box framework and 10 years of data. Through a 10 year time-series attribution analysis, I decompose returns into allocation, implementation, and total effects to assess how style, capitalization, and manager decisions contributed to performance over time.
